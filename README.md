# ICT342 Teaching Database Project

## Project Breakdown

The current developer team has picked this project up: *Tshering* *Jack* and *Bradley*. 
Previous developers of this project that we are building upon are *Damian*, *Geordie*, *Jaspreet* & *Ron*. 
It's about creating an Accessible Database, to manage, sort, and allocate teachers for courses.
The database was made in MySQL, a databasing software the University supplies, and it works well for the system the client wants.
This will be hosted via Putty, an SSH and Telnet client, designed to run off its own server.
To pull all of it together it will be compiled with Python to host and run the Front end website.
